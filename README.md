# Portfolio_Page
A portfolio page created as a project for the second week of the Tec de Monterrey coding bootcamp. 

## My Portfolio
Although it was created as a homework assignment, I will continue to use this as my oficial portfolio page. 
I will be implementing changes as I learn new topics and try to apply them to my page. Aside from the skills
visible on the page, the main purpose of this page is to provide a compilation of the projects I have worked on 
as well as some information about myself. 

### Technology Used
Since it is a static page, the main technologies used were HTML and CSS. To try and make the website responsive
I mainly used flexbox styling. It took me a while to get the hang of flex and there are still things I need to 
learn, but with consistent practice I feel like I could continue making good progress.
